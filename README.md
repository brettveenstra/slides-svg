# SVG: So Very Good

Slides and other materials built using [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) and other nifty things.

The most iteration [is publicly accessible](http://tylersticka.github.io/slides-svg/), with previous iterations entombed as protected branches. 

## Talk Description

Icon fonts! CSS-only illustrations! High-resolution GIF animations! Today's web designers still regularly and enthusiastically employ these techniques... yet they're all a better fit for SVG, a powerful vector image format that's already old enough to drive a car.

Join Cloud Four's Lead Designer Tyler Sticka for an impassioned introduction to your new favorite image format: What it is, how it works, and why it's so awesome.
